# UMAP-and-Conformer

Inside the main.ipynb:

1.1 : The section includes the brief summary of a paper published in 2018 by Leland McInnes, John Healy and James Melville. The paper was about UMAP ( Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ). The technique for dimensionality reduction. 
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426

1.2 : An example which implements UMAP. Using the UMAP library, higher dimensions of a dataset are transformed into lower dimensions.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernandolima23/classification-in-asteroseismology

2.1 : This section summarize briefly about the Conformer paper published in 2020. Explains about Convolution augmented Transformers. Basically the combination of CNNs and Transformers.
Paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100

2.2 : A keyword Spotter is built using a pretrained model and a dataset from Huggingface.

Dataset : https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/speech_commands

3.1 : Now, using an audiofeature dataset UMAP is implemneted to reduce the dimensions of the data without loosing much underlying information.
